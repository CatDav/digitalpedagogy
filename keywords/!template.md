# KEYWORD ENTRY TEMPLATE

**Note: Maximum Length for each keyword entry (including works cited) is 3000 words**

**The entry should be authored in Markdown, saved as an .md file. If you'd like, then you can simply copy the [raw Markdown for this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/master/keywords/!template.md) and replace it with your own content.**

Please email your assigned editor with any questions or concerns. Your assigned editor is the person who contacted you with details about this template.

## 1. Author Name(s)
Institutional Affiliation & Website

## 2. Bulleted List of Curated Pedagogical Artifacts

For quick reference, provide a bulleted list of the ten pedagogical artifacts featured in your keyword entry. Please provide ten artifacts. No more, no less. These artifacts should reflect what you and others use to teach your keyword. What teaching and learning projects do you turn to when crafting your teaching materials? What prompts or assignments have inspired you? Which or whose syllabi have you borrowed from, revised, or built upon?

* "Title," Creator, URL (Project Type)

Example: "English 101," Pat Patterson, university.edu/101syllabus.pdf (syllabus)

Sample artifacts include:
* Syllabus
* Essay (avoid reflective essay)
* Teaching Guidelines
* Assignment
* Lesson Plan 
* Website (with pedagogical materials)
* Collaborative Project
* Co-authored Document 
* University/College Initiative 

## 3. Curatorial Statement (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)

The curatorial statement expresses your vision of the keyword — what it means in a pedagogical context and how you approached the task of curating pedagogical artifacts around it. Statements can include some or all of the following: 

* Vision statement (how do you envision or understand this keyword and its relation to pedagogy?)
* Scholarly rationale for selections 
* Criteria for selections (why were the specific curated resources selected?) 
* Important issues (why teach this now? why does this topic matter for students? for faculty? for a field? what makes this keyword unique or exemplary for digital pedagogy?) 
* Particular intersections with your pedagogical philosophy/teaching conditions (how and where do you teach issues related to this keyword? in what course(s)? with what learning expectations/outcomes in mind? with or without what resources? what are your students' backgrounds, interests, or investments?) 

## 4. Curated Pedagogical Resources (ten resources, each with metadata, a screenshot, and a 150-word annotation)

Select ten pedagogical resources to feature for your keyword. The emphasis is on curating pedagogical resources for each keyword -- the everyday stuff of teaching -- more than second-hand reflections on teaching. Each resource should include: 

* Screenshot (PNG or JPG), titled “keyword resource name,” e.g. “work AfAm syllabus.png”
* Source URL 
* A Copy of the Resource (in HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, MP3, MP4, MOV, PNG, or JPG), if possible 
* Name of Creator
* Attribution Information (Author, University/College) 
* An annotation of **no more than 150 words** that includes:
	* Brief statement of Aim/Purpose of the Resource (what is it?) 
	* Brief statement on Its Relevance to the Keyword (why is it important/useful, what does it do well, how does it exemplify digital pedagogy) 
	* Guidelines for Use (how to integrate it into a course, what might need revision/adaptation)

We have begun a list of FAQ in a ReadMe file (https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/README.md) in addition to a description of the project (https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/description.md) and all other keywords (https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy/blob/master/listOfKeywords.md). We have not yet publicized the list of keywords or the description and ask that for now we keep them private.

Feel free to push these resources to a server for remote access, and then send us the URL. In your Markdown file, you can just include file names (e.g., keyword screenshot1.png) for our reference, with the annotations and other information following them. Ultimately, all of your resources will be intergrated in this repository (curateteaching/digitalpedagogy). 

Once we receive your entry, we will review and edit it (where necessary), return the proof to you (for approval/revision), and then forward the approved proof to the MLA. Later, the keyword and the entire *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* collection will be made available online (open access) for open review. That said, please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about the open review process, or about rendering your work discoverable online. In the interests of transparency, I should note that we are still fleshing out the particulars of this review process with the MLA, and we want to keep our curators' needs and interests in mind as we do so.  


## 5. Related Materials (Bulleted List)

In MLA format, list five related items or resources that are informative for teaching with your keyword in mind. **Please only include five items. No more, no less.**

For each item, include Author, Title, and URL

Items may include: 
* Scholarly journal article
* Book 
* Video, audio, or other dynamic media
* Crowdsourced document 
* Blog post 
* Website

## 6. Works Cited 

A works cited for all references in your entry, including your ten resources, your five related materials, and anything referenced in your curatorial statement.
