### Curatorial Statement 

What is queer digital pedagogy?  What lies at the intersection and intertwingling of queer and technology and teaching? 

JENTERY: Would "What lies at the intersection and intertwingling of queer, technology, and teaching?" be ok? 

Foremost queer digital pedagogy understands that technology is never neutral and that the digital is a constellation of spaces, practices, and protocols that can be both liberatory and regulatory, both queer and deeply normative.  

JENTERY: Wonderfully concise! 

To queer the digital means to challenge the very idea that there are those who belong online or naturally "get tech" and those who are merely observers, vistors, and worst yet, unwelcome interlopers. 

JENTERY: Would "vistors, or, worst yet, unwelcome interlopers" also work? I ask because you use "or" earlier in the sentence, and I wonder if the second half should correspond. 

Though the language of "native" and "immigrant" likely came from John Perry Barlow's ["A Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace,"](https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html) Mark Prensky extends the problematic and techno-orientalizing metaphor, saying:

> What should we call these "new" students of today? Some refer to them as the N-[for Net]-gen or D-[for digital]-gen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is *Digital Natives*. Our students today are all "native speakers" of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. So what does that make the rest of us? Those of us who were not born into the digital world but have, at some later point in our lives, become fascinated by and adopted many or most aspects of the new technology are, and always will be compared to them, *Digital Immigrants*" (1-2).  

Queer digital pedagogy noisily refuses the "digital native" and "digital immigrant" narratives (now turned teaching philosophies and institutional policies), which rely on stereotypes and norms about race, gender, class, ability, and even pleasure. Queering the digital and queering pedagogy then is, in the words of Eve Sedgwick, about "promises to make invisible possibilities and desires visible; to make the tacit things explicit; to smuggle queer representation in where it must be smuggled and . . . to challenge queer-eradicating impulses frontally where they are to be so challenged" (3). 

JENTERY: Compelling transition here toward blackboxing and technoculture studies. 

Given the black box-ness of code, virtual reality, and information technologies—which are paradoxically airy, transparent yet arcane, and obscured—this work of decoding, remaking, and transfiguring is much needed across everyday screens, workbenches, classrooms, and popular culture as a whole. 

JENTERY: Would it be worth mentioning that technologies are also alluring? I'm thinking of Stone and Chun here, among others. Not sure. Just thought I'd mention it. 

Teachers, programmers, scholars, librarians, artists, gamers, and off- and onliners must embrace "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning . . . [and] the experimental linguistic, epistemological, representational, political adventures" (Sedgwick 8) of queer digital pedagogy.  

JENTERY: Would you be willing to add a sentence after this one that brings Sedgwich concisely into the context of this keyword and into the context of queering the digital? What would that embrace look like from a teaching and learning perspective, e.g.? 
The selections curated above represent the messiness and unruly impossibility of "representing" queer digital pedagogy in any easy, unitary, frictionless way. They are meant to be inspirations, puzzle pieces, and half-nibbled ideas that rub up against one another in fruitful and fraught ways.  

JENTERY: Well put! Love it. 

They are provocations rather than proscriptions that hopefully demonstrate the remarkable range, color, and flexibility of what it means to intervene in traditional humanities studies and to interrogate the technonormativity of digital media and methodologies.  

JENTERY: If you were to replace "traditional" with another word or two, then what would the word(s) be? 

They also reflect different perspectives, areas of interest, and different levels of proficiency with digital work. Digital pedagogy must follow the lead of queer theory and queer studies, which are increasingly intersectional and interdisciplinary, no longer seeing "sexuality as a singular mode of inquiry and instead makes sexuality a central category of analysis in the study of racialization, transnationalism, and globalization" (Halberstam 361). From syllabi to blog posts, from student works to institutional policies, from scholarly texts to digital games, the selections are often metacognitive in approach and content, revealing not only what it means to teach queer material digitally, or how to use technology queerly, but also the stakes in these reconfigurations and repurposings. They provide a scaffolding, a table full of curiosities to play with much in the spirit of Raymond Williams's original *Keywords* project—"a vocabulary: a shared body of words and meanings" (15).  

JENTERY: Would you be willing to add a sentence or two at the end of this paragraph about how these selections are integrated into the everyday of teaching and learning? Or about the challenges of doing so, of intersecting theory and practice? If only to better transition into the next paragarph, and into Halberstam's observations? 

If queer pedagogy is about "the problem of curriculum [becoming] one of prolifierating identifications not closing them down" (Britzman 219), then queer digital pedagogy is about finding, creating, and playing with multimodal and polyamorous questions, algorithms, archives, and artifacts, analog and digital, flesh-to-flesh and virtual. Judith Halberstam argues, "[W]hile queer studies offers a potent critique of disciplinarity and pedagogy, it also offers an interesting interface with new digital technologies and the development of smart classrooms and Web-based learning . . . [with] flexible and innovated notions of archiving, canonicity, disciplinarity and intellectual labor in hand" (364). In other words, queer digital pedagogy asks teachers and students, readers and writers, makers and players to be perverse, to be critical and reparative, to invest in these queer sites and moments with "fascination and love" (Sedgwick 3). Whether you are tweeting close readings of *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, looking for resources about LGBT inclusion, or navigating a virtual maze as flashing-rainbow square, queer digital pedagogy demands not only a healthy suspicion of the promises and fantasies of technology but also a healthy desire for "this wave new technologies to bring new methods and topics to the classroom" (Halberstam 364).  It is this spirit, this utopian hope, that inspires the above selections.  

JENTERY: Great paragraph! 

> Queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of 
the present . . . Queerness is that thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough, that indeed something is 
missing . . . Queerness is also a performative because it is not simply a being but a doing for and toward the future.  
Queerness is essentially about the rejection of a here and now and an insistence on potentiality or concrete 
possibility for another world. --Jose Esteban Munoz, *Cruising Utopia*

### Curated Resources 

JENTERY: Would you be willing to email use a screengrab for each of these? I believe you gathered them, but we couldn't access them. Sorry! 

[Refracting the Digital Humanities](http://thejarahtree.com/2014/07/05/refracting-digital-humanities/)
* Jarah Moesch
* American Studies, University of Maryland, College Park

Self-described as "an experimental artist-scholar who uses the queer sick body to challenge the limits of the phenomenological," Moesch's course and syllabus offer an intersectional way to examine the ways "the methods and tools used and produced by Digital Humanists function as organizing principles that frame how race, gender, sexuality, and ability." What is exemplary about this resource is the fact that Moesch's syllabus solidly combines theory and practice, exploring and doing. As the course description reads, "By pairing hands-on learning/making with Critical Race Theory, Queer, and Gender Theories, we will interrogate the structures of the tools themselves while creating our own collaborative practices and methods for ‘doing’ (refracting) DH differently."

JENTERY: Have you used or adapted Moesch's work for your own teaching? If so, mind adding a sentence or two about that use, including what went well (for you, or for the students)? 

[ENGL 1102: Queer New Media](http://queergatech.tumblr.com/)
* Marty Fink
* Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow, School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Tech

Multimodal, intersectional, and colorful, Fink's introductory course outlines ways to think about and create queer narratives and cultural productions. The course website provides examples of various student responses and projects, including student-made digital games. The strengths of this resource are in its eclecticism, its use of both popular culture and more traditional literature, and the examples of digital work created by students.  

JENTERY: Have you used or adapted Fink's work for your own teaching? If so, mind adding a sentence or two about that use, including what went well (for you, or for the students)? 

[Digital Pedagogy: Twitter, Close Reading, and Learning/Teaching in Public](http://litilluminations.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/digital-pedagogy-close-reading-and-learning-in-public/)
* Petra Dierkes-Thrun
* Lecturer, Comparative Literature, Stanford University

Dierkes-Thrun's website offers a quick overview of the variety of different digital pedagogy exercises and assignments she has developed for her literature seminars and feminist, gender and sexuality classes at Stanford, including "Twitter for Crowdsourcing and Role-Play Exercises," close reading and collaborative interpretation exercises, and other teaching and learning tools. This resource serves as a jumping off point for adapting Dierkes-Thrun's assignments or for generating new ones. What is most useful is the inclusion of reflection on the assignments by both the instructor and the students.

JENTERY: Would you be willing to elaborate (in a sentence or two) on why this reflection is useful?

[iLogs](http://www.edmondchang.com/466/assignments.html)
* Edmond Y. Chang
* Assistant Professor, English, Drew University

These brief assignments ask students to keep and maintain a weekly "identity log" or "iLog," recording, detailing, and thinking about their own identities and identifications. These "iLogs" will function as a kind of identity workbook, an analytical and metacognitive journal, connecting students' observations and experiences to the texts, theories, and ideas of an Introduction to LGBT Studies class. Prompts include thinking about identities, sexuality, queer space, and popular culture, which are shared with the class via the class's Tumblr website. The overall course syllabus and reading list are included as well.  

[Queer Geek Theory: Classes](http://www.queergeektheory.org/teaching_main/classes/)
* Alexis Lothian
* Assistant Professor, Women's Studies/LGBTQ Studies, University of Maryland

This resource offers a range of courses and reflections on teaching queer, LGBTQ, and women's studies material. Included in Lothian's descriptions are specific mentions of incorporating digital humanities and digital technologies into the classes.  Lothian encourages the sharing of course rationales, assignments, and integrations of digital tools, saying, "I definitely consider all of the syllabi linked above to be open source documents from which other teachers should borrow as they see fit."

JENTERY: Have you used or adapted Lothian's work for your own teaching? If so, mind adding a sentence or two about that use, including what went well (for you, or for the students)? 

[Best Practices: Creating an LGBT-inclusive School Climate](http://www.tolerance.org/lgbt-best-practices)
* Teaching Tolerance
* A Project of the southern Law Poverty Center

Part of the Teaching Tolerance project, this website offers a list of resources and best practices for teachers, administartors, and schools to give them "the knowledge they need to create a climate in which their most vulnerable students feel safe and valued . . . to build an educational environment that is truly welcoming to all students." Though the resource is aimed at middle and secondary schools, the "LGBT 101"-style material and inclusive policies are a necessary starting point in developing vocabularies, course rationales, teaching philosophies, and ways to think about the institution.  

[#TransformDH](http://transformdh.org/)
* #TransformDH

What is important about the #TransformDH blog and collaborative project is the idea that the digital humanities must be a more open, inclusive, and diverse space, discipline, and set of inquiries. #TransformDH hopes to "do" race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class. As a project that grew out of the experiences, scholarship, and activism of a handful of people across institutions, #TransformDH is exemplary in its demonstration of collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and grass-roots "making" and "doing" in digital humanities.  

JENTERY: Would you be willing to add a sentence that points to specific things you find compelling on the site? Or about the site? 

[Digital Storytelling Project](http://queeringthemuseum.org/current-projects/digital-storytelling-project/)
* Digital Story Telling Project
* A Project of Queering the Museum

The Digital Storytelling Project is a Seattle-based project suppored by Queering the Museum, a group dedicated to increasing LGBTQ representation in museums. The storytelling project invites LGBTQ individuals from the Puget Sound region to reflect on their lives, to use their own narration and photos to create a short video. The project allows people to tell their own stories, to decide how they want to be represented, and to share these stories in a queer-themed exhibit at The Museuem of History and Industry in Seattle.

[Lim](http://mkopas.net/files/Lim/)
* Merritt Kopas

On the surface, Lim is a very simple game where the play moves a small, flashing, multi-hued square through a maze populated by other squares. At first, the other squares do not bother the player's avatar as long as they blend in, changing their color to match those around them. But, as the player progresses, the other squares begin to attack the player's square. Lim is about many things: identity, difference, belonging, passing, inclusion, exclusion, community, and so on. The game is brief, accessible, and demonstrative of not only queer issues and concerns but of the success of queer, independent game-makers such as Merritt Kopas.  

JENTERY: If you have taught Lim, then would you be willing to include a sentence or two giving some perspective on how you taught it, or what you discussed? 

[Queer Feminist Media Practice](http://queeringthemuseum.org/current-projects/digital-storytelling-project/)
* Edited by Aristea Fotopoulou and Kate O'Riordan
* Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology

This special issue of *Ada* hopes, in the words of the editors, to explore "what the concept of praxis could offer in our thinking about the intersections of gender, digital media, and technology. Praxis in both Marxist and in Arendtian political thought brings together theory, philosophy and political action into the realm of the everyday." The special issue also highlights the ways that digital projects like the journal *Ada* can be open source, be committed to an "transparent, productive, and rigorous peer review process," and be created, designed, published, and distributed collectively online.
