### Curatorial Statement 

What is queer digital pedagogy?  What lies at the intersection and intertwingling of queer and technology and teaching? 
Foremost queer digital pedagogy understands that technology is never neutral and that the digital is a constellation of 
spaces, practices, and protocols that can be both liberatory and regulatory, both queer and deeply normative.  To queer 
the digital means to challenge the very idea that there are those who belong online or naturally "get tech" and those 
who are merely observers, vistors, and worst yet, unwelcome interlopers.  Though the language of "native" and "immigrant" 
likely came from John Perry Barlow's "A Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace," Mark Prensky extends the problematic 
and techno-orientalizing metaphor, saying, "What should we call these 'new' students of today?  Some refer to them as 
the N-[for Net]-gen or D-[for digital]-gen.  But the most useful designation I have found for them is *Digital Natives*.  

Our students today are all 'native speakers' of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet.   So what 
does that make the rest of us?  Those of us who were not born into the digital world but have, at some later point in 
our lives, become fascinated by and adopted many or most aspects of the new technology are, and always will be compared 
to them, *Digital Immigrants*."  Queer digital pedagogy noisily refuses the "digital native" and "digital immigrant" 
narratives now turned teaching philosophies and institutional policies, which rely on stereotypes and norms about race, 
gender, class, ability, even pleasure.  Queering the digital and queering pedagogy then is, in the words of Eve Sedgwick, 
about "promises to make invisible possibilities and desires visible; to make the tacit things explicit; to smuggle 
queer representation in where it must be smuggled and…to challenge queer-eradicating impulses frontally where they 
are to be so challenged" (3).  Given the black box-ness of code, virtual reality, and information technologies--which 
are paradoxically airy, transparent yet arcane, and obscured--this work of decoding, remaking, and transfiguring is much 
needed across everyday screens, workbenches, classrooms, and popular culture as a whole.  Teachers, programmers, 
scholars, librarians, artists, gamers, and off- and onliners must embrace "the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, 
overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning…[and] the experimental linguistic, epistemological, 
representational, political adventures" (Sedgwick 8) of queer digital pedagogy.  

The selections curated above represent the messiness and unruly impossibility of "representing" queer digital pedagogy 
in any easy, unitary, frictionless way.  Rather, they are meant to be inspirations, puzzle pieces, and half-nibbled 
ideas that rub up against one another in fruitful and fraught ways.  They are provocations rather than proscriptions 
that hopefully demonstrate the remarkable range, color, and flexibility of what it means to intervene in traditional 
humanities studies and to interrogate the technonormativity of digital media and methodologies.  They also reflect 
different perspectives, areas of interest, and different levels of proficiency with digital work.  Digital pedagogy 
must follow the lead of queer theory and queer studies, which are increasingly intersectional and interdisciplinary 
no longer seeing "sexuality as a singular mode of inquiry and instead makes sexuality a central category of analysis 
in the study of racialization, transnationalism, and globalization" (Halberstam 361).  From syllabi to blog posts, 
from student works to institutional policies, from scholarly texts to digital games, the selections are often 
metacognitive in approach and content, revealing not only what it means to teach queer material digitally, how to 
use technology queerly, but also what are the stakes in these reconfigurations and repurposings.  They provide a 
scaffolding, a table full of curiosities to play with much in the spirit of Raymond Williams's original Keywords 
project--"a vocabulary: a shared body of words and meanings" (15).  

If queer pedagogy is about "the problem of curriculum [becoming] one of prolifierating identifications not closing 
them down" (Britzman 219) then queer digital pedagogy is about finding, creating, and playing with multimodal and 
polyamorous questions, algorithms, archives, and artifacts, analog and digital, flesh-to-flesh and virtual.  
Judith Halberstam argues, "[W]hile queer studies offers a potent critique of disciplinarity and pedagogy, it also 
offers an interesting interface with new digital technologies and the development of smart classrooms and Web-based 
learning…[with] flexible and innovated notions of archiving, canonicity, disciplinarity and intellectual labor in 
hand" (364).  In other words, queer digital pedagogy asks teachers and students, readers and writers, makers and 
players to be perverse, to be critical and reparative, to invest in these queer sites and moments with "fascination 
and love" (Sedgwick 3).  Whether you are tweeting close readings of The Picture of Dorian Gray or looking for 
resources about LGBT inclusion or navigating a virtual maze as flashing-rainbow square, queer digital pedagogy 
demands not only a healthy suspicion of the promises and fantasies of technology but also a healthy desire for 
"this wave new technologies to bring new methods and topics to the classroom" (Halberstam 364).  It is this spirit, 
this utopian hope that inspires the above selections.  

> "Queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of 
the present…Queerness is that thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough, that indeed something is 
missing...Queerness is also a performative because it is not simply a being but a doing for and toward the future.  
Queerness is essentially about the rejection of a here and now and an insistence on potentiality or concrete 
possibility for another world."
> --Jose Esteban Munoz, Cruising Utopia

### Curated Resources 

[Refracting the Digital Humanities](http://thejarahtree.com/2014/07/05/refracting-digital-humanities/)
* Jarah Moesch
* American Studies, University of Maryland, College Park

Self-described as "an experimental artist-scholar who uses the queer sick body to challenge the limits of the phenomenological," Moesch's course and syllabus offer an intersectional way to examine the ways "the methods and tools used and produced by Digital Humanists function as organizing principles that frame how race, gender, sexuality, and ability."  What is exemplary about this resource is the fact that Moesch's syllabus solidly combines theory and practice, exploring and doing.  As the course description reads, "By pairing hands-on learning/making with Critical Race Theory, Queer, and Gender Theories, we will interrogate the structures of the tools themselves while creating our own collaborative practices and methods for ‘doing’ (refracting) DH differently."

[ENGL 1102: Queer New Media](http://queergatech.tumblr.com/)
* Marty Fink
* Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow, School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Tech

Multimodal, intersectional, and colorful, Fink's introductory course outlines ways to think about and create queer narratives and cultural productions.  The course website provides examples of various student responses and projects, including student-made digital games. The strengths of this resource are in its eclecticism, its use of both popular culture and more traditional literature, and the examples of digital work created by students.  

[Digital Pedagogy: Twitter, Close Reading, and Learning/Teaching in Public](http://litilluminations.wordpress.com/2014/01/31/digital-pedagogy-close-reading-and-learning-in-public/)
* Petra Dierkes-Thrun
* Lecturer, Comparative Literature, Stanford University

Dierkes-Thrun's website offers a quick overview of the variety of different digital pedagogy exercises and assignments she has developed for her literature seminars and feminist, gender and sexuality classes at Stanford, including "Twitter for Crowdsourcing and Role-Play Exercises," close reading and collaborative interpretation exercises, and other teaching and learning tools.  This resource serves as a jumping off point for adapting Dierkes-Thrun's assignments or for generating new ones.  What is most useful is the inclusion of reflection on the assignments by both the instructor and the students.

[iLogs](http://www.edmondchang.com/466/assignments.html)
* Edmond Y. Chang
* Assistant Professor, English, Drew University

These brief assignments ask students to keep and maintain a weekly "identity log" or "iLog," recording, detailing, and thinking about their own identities and identifications.  These "iLogs" will function as a kind of identity workbook, an analytical and metacognitive journal, connecting students' observations and experiences to the texts, theories, and ideas of an Introduction to LGBT Studies class. Prompts range from thinking about identities, sexuality, queer space, and popular culture, which are share with the class via the class's Tumblr website.  The overall course syllabus and reading list are included as well.  

[Queer Geek Theory: Classes](http://www.queergeektheory.org/teaching_main/classes/)
* Alexis Lothian
* Assistant Professor, Women's Studies/LGBTQ Studies, University of Maryland

This resource offers a range of courses and reflections on teaching queer, LGBTQ, and women's studies material.  Included in Lothian's descriptions are specific mentions of incorporating digital humanities and digital technologies into the classes.  Lothian encourages the sharing of course rationales, assignments, and integrations of digital tools, saying, "I definitely consider all of the syllabi linked above to be open source documents from which other teachers should borrow as they see fit."

[Best Practices: Creating an LGBT-inclusive School Climate](http://www.tolerance.org/lgbt-best-practices)
* Teaching Tolerance
* A Project of the southern Law Poverty Center

Part of the Teaching Tolerance project, this website offers a list of resources and best practices for teachers, administartors, and schools to give them "the knowledge they need to create a climate in which their most vulnerable students feel safe and valued...to build an educational environment that is truly welcoming to all students."  Though the resource is aimed at middle and secondary schools, the "LGBT 101"-style material and inclusive policies are a necessary starting point in developing vocabularies, course rationales, teaching philosophies, and ways to think about the institution.  

[#TransformDH](http://transformdh.org/)
*#TransformDH

What is important about the #TransformDH blog and collaborative project is the idea that the digital humanities must be an more
open, inclusive, and diverse space, discipline, and set of inquiries.  #TransformDH hopes to "do" race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class.  As a project that grew out of the experiences, scholarship, and activism of a handful of people across institutions, #TransformDH is exemplary in its demonstration of collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and grass-roots "making" and "doing" in digital humanities.  


[Digital Storytelling Project](http://queeringthemuseum.org/current-projects/digital-storytelling-project/)
* Digital Story Telling Project
* A Project of Queering the Museum

The Digital Storytelling Project is a Seattle-based project suppored by Queering the Museum, a group dedicated to increasing LGBTQ representation in museums.  The storytelling project invites LGBTQ individuals from the Puget Sound region to reflect on their lives, to use their own narration and photos to create a short video.  The project allows people to tell their own stories, to decide how they want to be represented, and to share these stories in a queer-themed exhibit at The Museuem of History and Industry in Seattle.


[Lim](http://mkopas.net/files/Lim/)
* Merritt Kopas

On the surface, Lim is a very simple game where the play moves a small, flashing, multi-hued square through a maze populated by other squares. At first, the other squares do not bother the player's avatar as long as they blend in, changing their color to match those around them.  But, as the player progresses, the other squares begin to attack the player's square.  Lim is about many things: identity, difference, belonging,passing, inclusion, exclusion, community, and so on.  The game is brief, accessible, and demonstrative of not only queer issues and concerns but of the success of queer, independent game-makers like Merritt Kopas.  

[Queer Feminist Media Practice](http://queeringthemuseum.org/current-projects/digital-storytelling-project/)
* Edited by Aristea Fotopoulou and Kate O'Riordan
* Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology

This special issue of Ada hopes, in the words of the editors to explore "what the concept of praxis could offer in our thinking about the intersections of gender, digital media, and technology. Praxis in both Marxist and in Arendtian political thought brings together theory, philosophy and political action into the realm of the everyday."  The special issue also highlights the ways that digital projects like the journal Ada can be open source, be committed to an "transparent, productive, and rigorous peer review process," and be created, designed, published, and distributed collectively online.
