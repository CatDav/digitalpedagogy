## CURATORIAL STATEMENT (roughly 750-800 words, MLA Format)


Keyword: Race (MLA Edition on Digital Pedagogy)
===============================================

Adeline Koh

While it may not seem like it on first inspection, issues of race
and ethnicity are deeply embedded in technology. European colonial
discourses from the eighteenth century onwards deployed the ideology
that “civilized” groups deserved supremacy over others because of
their superior technology. They located this superiority in multiple fields, from
advances in Western scientific knowledge to the West’s development of modern military
equipment and artillery. Postcolonial scholarship has largely
challenged this assumption, with critics arguing that the modernity
of non-Europeans actually predates the European construct of
modernity, or that notions of modernity need to be expanded
(Chakrabarty, Ong, Prakash, Diop). Even in contemporary discourse,
technology continues to be racialized by the assumption that people
in “developing” nations or from minority populations are outsiders
to technology. This belief is inaccurate. For example, as Anna
Everett has shown, far from being outsiders to the early years of
cyberspace, African Americans and African diasporic peoples were
actually early adopters of information age technology. The
persistence of this mode of thought in contemporary times indicates the cultural 
significance of race and ethnicity in technology and digital cultures. 

Given this historical backdrop, any responsible representation of race and
technology should offer challenges to and an expansion of how digital
pedagogy and digital humanities are defined. The selection of
artifacts in this keyword represents such a deliberate political
choice. It argues that most seminal digital humanities
work on race does not fit into traditional notions of digital
humanities research because it has been initiated and developed outside of
the academy. It locates this work in activist politics, in new modes of crowdfunding, and
in private foundations, among others. The majority of this work has not
received the sorts of governmental, federal and institutional support
other less politicized work has. This is not a new critique; a variety
of scholars (Earhart, Koh)have argued that the majority of the extant digital humanities
corps overly focuses on authors and cultural producers of European descent. 

Thus on first look, a visitor to this project may find some of the selections in
this entry slightly odd. Some of these projects do not resonate as
typical “digital humanities” work because they began and continue to
exist outside of the academy without institutional support. Others
might appear unusual because they are simple blog posts or google
documents—artifacts whose production does not require much technical
expertise, thereby raising the question of whether they adequately
“count” as digital humanities pedagogy or research.

This choice is intentional. Through this curation, this collection seeks to expand 
the definition of “digital humanities” and “digital pedagogy” beyond the academy, and
beyond the conventional understanding that “doing digital humanities”
work requires deep technical knowledge. Through its composition, it
makes the argument that the included work should count as digital
humanities research and teaching.  This is because this work 1)
exists on digital infrastructures, and 2) because they are
representative of the definition of the humanities: the process and
documentation of the human experience.

In so doing, this project thus defines “digital humanities pedagogy” as one which actively uses the
digital space to create, build upon and sustain communities and
networks. In draws on bell hooks’ definition of “engaged
pedagogy,” a pedagogy which emphasizes the self-actualization of both
the teacher as well as the students, one which prioritizes having the
classroom as a community learn together the social, material and
political relationships that exist within the classroom and without.
It also draws upon Jesse Stommel’s concept of “critical digital
pedagogy,” which “centers its practice on community and
collaboration; must remain open to diverse, international voices […];
will not, cannot, be defined by a single voice but must gather a
cacophony of voices; must have use and application outside
traditional institutions of education.” 

The projects that make up this curated list exemplify these definitions of engaged pedagogy and
critical digital pedagogy, and many break down the barriers of the
academy to the public. A final note: this curated list is not
intended to be an exhaustive look at the field of race and the
digital humanities and digital pedagogy—indeed, it cannot completely
represent this entire field. This keyword, then, is only the
beginnings of an attempt to open up definitions of “digital
humanities” and “digital pedagogy.”

## CURATED ARTIFACTS (ten artifacts, each with metadata, a screenshot, and a 150-word annotation)

	Artifacts (in alphabetical order, by title)
    ===========================================


	1. *Artifact Title: African Diaspora PhD 
    *Artifact Type: Directory of Atlantic African diaspora history scholarship
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: http://africandiasporaphd.com/ 
	*Copy of artifact: 
	*Creator and Affiliation: Jessica Marie Johnson, Michigan State University,
	Kidada Williams, Wayne State University
    *Annotation: African Diaspora, Ph.D. is a curated blog that highlights
    scholarship and scholars in the field of Atlantic African diaspora history.
    This valuable resource is useful for students to gain an overview of 
    current issues in Atlantic African diaspora history, and its relevance
    to contemporary race issues. It also provides a useful index of scholars
    working on this topic, many of whom are people of color. Students could be
    tasked with creating a literature review on this topic through researching
    this directory. 
    

	2. *Artifact Title: #FergusonSyllabus 
	*Artifact Type: Crowdsourced Syllabus 
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwZl23Q9tgZ23dxSJWS-WpjZhOZ_mzVPtWL8-pWuLt8/edit/edit?pli=1#heading=h.l15kj4sa2rn0] 
    *Copy of artifact: 
    *Creator and Affiliation: Marcia Chatelain (hashtag originator), Georgetown University
    Dan Krutka (Google document host & faciliator), Texas Women's University
    Annotation: This is a crowdsourced Google document containing resources and annotations that are helpful for instructors teaching about the events and reactions that occurred in Ferguson, MO in late 2014, when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson. Wilson has not faced any charges for his actions. Widespread protests in Ferguson and on social media have resulted. Prof. Marcia Chatelain at Georgetown University then started the hashtag #FergusonSyllabusto provide sources for people wishing to learn and teach more about the historical context that resulted in the Michael Brown shooting; in particular, larger patterns of systemic racism and police brutality. This google document is one such product of the #FergusonSyllabus hashtag. It collates many sources offered by the public, including annotations, links and ideas forinstructors.

	3. *Artifact Title: Mapping Police Violence 
	*Artifact Type: Mapping tool 
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ 
	*Copy of artifact: 
	*Creator and Affiliation: Deray McKesson, Netta, Samuel Sinyangwe, all of WeTheProtestors.org) 
	Annotation: This site offers easy to read and to use visualizations of crowdsourced data on people of have been shot and/or killed by police. The collaborators base their data off databases such as FatalEncounters.org, the U.S. Police Shootings Database and KilledByPolice.net, along with original research from the team. The visuals clearly show that the number of black and Hispanic people killed by the police since May 2013 is inordinately high as compared with other races and ethnicities. The easy to use tables and data could provide an interesting classroom project investigating police shootings in a certain region, as well as course projects involving race and state violence.

	4. *Artifact Title: Mukurtu 
	*Artifact Type: Content Management System for indigenous communities to preserve
	*and share cultural heritage digitally
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: http://www.mukurtu.org/ 
	*Copy of artifact: 
	*Creator and Affiliation: Kim Christen (University of Washington, Pullman) and 
	Michael Ashley (University of California at Berkeley)
	*Annotation: Mukurtu is an open source content management system aimed at empowering indigenous communities to manage, share and exchange digital heritage in relevant and ethically-minded ways. It began as a response to the archival needs of the Waramungu Aboriginal community in the Central Australian town of Tennant Creek. While Mukurtu is free and open source, items contained within the database can be given different levels of permission for viewing and interacting, thereby providing greater flexibility for communities unwilling for their heritage collections to be completely open to the public. The CMS can easily be used in multiple ways for class  projects: exploring its functionality and reporting on its affordances and limitations in comparison with other similar database exhibition tools, and working together with a local community to build their own particular instance of Mukurtu for their uses, for example. 

	5. *Artifact Title: SAADA (South Asian American Digital Archive)
    *Artifact Type: Archive
    *Archive Screenshot: 
    *Source URL: https://www.saadigitalarchive.org/ 
    *Copy of artifact: 
    *Creator and Affiliation: Samip Mallick, SAADA 
    Annotation: SAADA is a digital archive that aims to increase the digital representation of South Asian Americans through documenting, preserving and sharing their stories. SAADA is registered as a non-profit organization based in Philadelphia, PA. Instructors can easily integrate much of the archive's material into courses on South Asia, American studies, diaspora studies as secondary material, getting students to research additional metadata and context to the objects, as well as possibly getting students involved in volunteering for the archive. 
    
    6. *Artifact Title: Soweto76
    *Artifact Type: 3D digital archive
    *Archive Screenshot:
    *Source URL: http://www.soweto76archive.org/ 
    *Copy of artifact:
    *Creator and Affiliation: Angel David Nieves, Hamilton College 
    *Annotation: This is a 3D virtual representation of the black township of Soweto, South Africa in 1976 on the Unity platform. It allows visitors to guide themselves through the 3D recreation of the township and learn about the historical significance of various places in Soweto. 1976 is an important historical year for the township as black high school students from Soweto took to the streets to protest the introduction of Afrikaans in place of English as the medium of instruction in local schools. Up to 700 students may have died in the protest. This protest was due to the perception of Afrikaans being linked to apartheid and to the language of the oppressor. The materials in the archive will be an excellent addition to courses on South Africa or about global race and ethnicity by introducing elements of visualization and geography into study of this historical protest. 
    

	7. *Artifact Title: Invisible Australians: The Real Face of White Australia 
	*Artifact Type: Archive/Exhibit 
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: http://invisibleaustralians.org/faces/ 
    *Copy of artifact: 
    *Creator and Affiliation: Kate Bagnall (ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, Tim Sherratt (National Library of Australia, University of Canberra)
    *Annotation: This archival project seeks to overturn the actual effectiveness of the "White Australia Policy," a state-directed racial policy developed in Australia since 1901 to restrict the immigration of non-white ethnicities into Australia, and the integration of racial minorities into Australian culture. Drawn from records of the National Archives of Australia, the visual wall of portraits of non-white Australians documents both the inaccuracy of the myth of an all-white Australia, as well as the monitoring and restriction of people who were the target of this policy. These sources can be used in courses on global race and ethnicity, particularly to introduce students to archival sources and their use in government policy. 


	8. *Artifact Title: #ThisTweetCalled My Back 
	*Artifact Type: Hashtag and tumblr blog
    *Screenshot: 
    *Source URL: https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23thistweetcalledmyback&src=typd 
    http://thistweetcalledmyback.tumblr.com/ 
    *Copy of artifact: 
    *Creator and Affiliation: @tgirlinterruptd, @chiefelk, @bad_dominicana, @aurabogado,
    @so_treu, @blackamazon, @thetrudz 
    *Annotation: #ThisTweetCalledMyBack is a hashtag movement from late 2014, in which women of color activists on Twitter called attention to the appropriation of much of their work on social media by both journalists, activists and academic. The hashtag references the seminal book *This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color*, edited and first published in 1981 by Cherríe Moraga, Gloria Anzaldua and Toni Cade Bambara. The hashtag can be taught in conjunction with themes of the appropriation of work by women of color in feminist movements and in relation to hashtag activism and new social media feminist movements and in comparison to their pre-internet counterparts.

	9. *#TransformDH 
	*Artifact Type: Tumblr blog
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: http://transformdh.org/ 
	*Copy of artifact: 
	*Creator and Affiliation: Anne Cong-Huyen (Whittier College), Alexis Lothian (University of Maryland),  Amanda Phillips (University of California, Davis), Melanie Kohnen (New York University), Moya Bailey (Northeastern  University), Marta S. Rivera Monclova (PhDeviate), Tanner Higgin (Common Sense Media), Fiona Barnett (Duke University), Anna Everett (University of California, Santa Barbara), Lisa Nakamura (University of Michigan), Tara McPherson (University of Southern California), Natalia Cecire (University of Sussex), Jessica M. Johnson (Michigan State University)
	*Annotation: #TransformDH is a fluid collective of people and ideas invested in the representation and scholarship of marginalized communities in the digital humanities. The tumblr blog would be good as an assigned reading in digital humanities classes, particularly in relation to considering the relationship of its content to the field at large.  

	10. *Afro Free Culture Wikimedia (AfroCROWD) Kickoff Edit-a-thons
	*Artifact Type: Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon 
	*Screenshot: 
	*Source URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/AfroCrowd
    *Copy of artifact: 
    *Creator and Affiliation: Multiple Wikipedia editors
    *Annotation: AfroCROWD is a Wikimedia initiative to increase the number of people of African descent who actively take part in the Wikimedia and free knowledge, culture and software movements. The event is part of Black WikiHistory Month, and is open to all Afrodescents who self-identify as being part of the diaspora. Student clubs and organizations focused on the African diaspora might be interested in organizing in-person nodes for these edit-a-thons. Instructors who are teaching more racially and ethnically classes can also help add to the project by contributing to the [WikiProject African Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_African_diaspora)
