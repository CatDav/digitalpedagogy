# HYBRID

### Jesse Stommel

REBECCA: Please add Institutional Affiliation & Website

## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In a broad sense, my own scholarly work is about the (sometimes wondrous, sometimes horrifying) relationship between bodies and technology. Specifically, I focus on learning communities, Critical Pedagogy, and the public digital humanities. I have taught face-to-face courses since 1999, hybrid courses since 2002, and fully online courses since 2007. I’ve taught in various disciplines, including literature, rhetoric and composition, education, film, and new media. Thinking about how we occupy physical and increasingly digital spaces has been the thread that connects my work across these disciplines.

REBECCA: Consider condensing the first two paragraphs.  They give the impression that this statement focuses on you rather than the keyword, hybrid.  I think that this statement is the most important there:  "Thinking about how we occupy physical and increasingly digital spaces has been the thread that connects my work across these disciplines."

In 2011, I founded the academic journal [*Hybrid Pedagogy*](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com): a digital journal of learning, teaching, and technology. 

REBECCA: I see the rest of this paragraph as the key definition of this keyword, that is, that hybrid engages both physical and digital selves in both physical and digital contexts and this is not just a matter of delivery mode.

My hypothesis is that all learning is necessarily hybrid. In classroom-based pedagogy, it is important to engage the digital selves of our students. And, in online pedagogy, it is equally important to engage their physical selves. With digital pedagogy and online education, our challenge is not to merely replace (or offer substitutes for) face-to-face instruction, but to find new and innovative ways to engage students in the practice of learning.

At a philosophical level, my own thinking about hybridity is influenced, in part, by the heated discussion of hybridity among postcolonial theorists. In “The Commitment to Theory,” from *The Location of Culture*, Homi Bhabha describes “the space of hybridity” as “the construction of a political object that is new, neither the one nor the other.” In [“A Cyborg Manifesto,”](http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/) Donna Haraway makes an explicit connection between postcolonial theory and what she describes as the colonizing work of machines: “By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism, in short, we are cyborgs.” 

There is an important way in which our roles as teachers and learners are bound up in who we are as humans (including our life experience, cultural background, race, gender, and sexuality). In *Hybridity*, Marwan M. Kraidy writes, “hybridity has proven a useful concept to describe multipurpose electronic gadgets, designer agricultural seeds, environment-friendly cars with dual combustion and electrical engines, companies that blend American and Japanese management practices, multiracial people, dual citizens, and postcolonial cultures” (1). For Kraidy, and for me, the term is powerful exactly because it resists easy signification.

At its most basic level, the term “hybrid,” as I’m using it here, refers to learning that happens both in a classroom (or other physical space) and online. In this respect, hybrid does overlap with another concept that is often used synonymously: blended. I would make a careful distinction between these two terms. Blended learning describes a process or practice; hybrid pedagogy is a methodological approach that helps define a series of varied processes and practices. (Blended learning is tactical, whereas hybrid pedagogy is strategic.) When people talk about “blended learning,” they are usually referring to the place where learning happens, a combination of the classroom and online. The word “hybrid” has deeper resonances, suggesting not just that the place of learning is changed but that a hybrid pedagogy fundamentally rethinks our conception of place. So, hybrid pedagogy does not just describe an easy mixing of on-ground and online learning, but is about bringing the sorts of learning that happen in a physical place and the sorts of learning that happen in a virtual place into a more engaged and dynamic conversation.

REBECCA: I love the point about the fundamental rethinking of place and how the hybrid breaks the boundaries of the classroom in multiple dimensions with the goal of empowering learners; if the classroom is a place of power for faculty then the hybrid is a place that destabilizes that power to make space for learner empowerment.  This statement gets at the way we see hybrid in the larger category of locations in our list of keywords; I'm glad that this is in the first batch because I think it makes an important statement about how the digital has transformed the location of learning

REBECCA: You might consider moving the paragraph on hybrid vs. blended up before the postcolonial theory. Then the assertion that hybrid has "deeper resonances" is elaborated in your discussion of postcolonial theorists. Or you might consider dropping most of these quotes and just keeping Kraidy.

This kind of learning is intensely social. It also turns on their head the traditional roles of student and teacher. In [“Rhizomatic Education: Community as Curriculum,”](http://davecormier.com/edblog/2008/06/03/rhizomatic-education-community-as-curriculum/) Dave Cormier argues that “curriculum is not driven by predefined inputs from experts; it is constructed and negotiated in real time by the contributions of those engaged in the learning process.” The hybrid learning environment is synchronous and asynchronous, on-ground and online, localized and dispersed. And it isn’t this and then that, but all these things simultaneously. Simply put, in a hybrid learning environment, there is no *front of the classroom*.

The resources I’ve curated here support this ethic. Each instructor and organization recognizes the ways hybrid learning environments empower students as full collaborators in the enterprise of education. These resources offer examples of hybrid strategies that are about more than replacing seat time with digital activities. Rather, the examples show how digital tools can be used to extend the classroom beyond its own bounds: continuing discussion outside scheduled class time; connecting a classroom in one geographical place with communities elsewhere; creating genuine audiences for student work; and defending the right of students to be teachers. While I’ve included a couple examples from my teaching, I do so not to champion my work but to champion the work of the students that ultimately owned these experiments. The best hybrid learning environments are built not as a convenience for teachers or institutions but in order to set a new kind of stage for students (both officially registered for a course but sometimes not) to improvise upon.

Finally, the keyword "hybrid" suggests a methodology for teachers to employ in constructing classes; however, I would strongly advocate that teachers also think about "hybrid" as a topic for students to investigate. I frequently begin the term in my classes by having us talk about what Rebekah Sheldon has called "the rhetoric of the room." We learn better in environments when we think critically and at a meta-level about how the design of those environments  influences the learning that happens within them. This is true of classrooms and libraries, but also learning management systems and social media platforms. So, each of these resources is as much a tool for teachers as it is a potential text for students to use in beginning this investigation.

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

### "A Million Blue Pages"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://amillionbluepages.net/ 
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Zach Whalen (University of Mary Washington)

The novel *House of Leaves* has produced an extensive network of digital marginalia. In 2011, Zach Whalen, Erin Templeton, Paul Benzon, Mark Sample, and Brian Croxall taught the novel together and [coauthored a collaborative assignment](http://www.briancroxall.net/dh/assignments/sharing-and-re-networking-house-of-leaves/) that bridged work being done by students at each of their institutions. I had just taught the novel that Summer, so I watched with rapt attention. The resource I’m including here is a 2014 follow-up to that experiment, which connected classes at University of Mary Washington, SUNY New Paltz, University of Texas at Austin, Emory University, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, University of Arizona, and University of California-Santa Barbara. *A Million Blue Pages* is a multimedia annotation / illustration of the various pages of *House of Leaves*. It serves as a wonderful example of students and teachers using digital tools to work together outside the constraints of geography and institutional affiliation. And the contributions to the site have continued well after the various courses involved ended. This, for me, is one of the key components of a well-designed hybrid assignment -- its ability to engage a community beyond its own bounds -- to create learning spaces without a clear end.

REBECCA: Please limit your annotations to 150 words.  You might cut some of the background to the resource you include, especially, "I had just taught the novel that Summer, so I watched with rapt attention."

### "A 12-week Assignment to Write a Wikipedia Article"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/Syllabi
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Wikimedia Foundation

This resource is a guide to constructing an assignment that has students contributing to a Wikipedia article. While the guide outlines a 12-week project, it can be adapted to any length. Even just the first step of orienting students to the back-end of Wikipedia begins to help them think critically about networked communities and knowledge construction on the Web. In Fall 2014, Adeline Koh incorporated this activity into her hybrid [Seminar in Feminist Theory](http://www.adelinekoh.org/blog/2014/08/20/syllabus-draft-gis-3614-seminar-in-feminist-theory-fall-2014/) as the major project of the class aimed at improving “conceptual skills, critical thinking, and oral and written communication.” More importantly, she contextualized the assignment within a discussion of how women and postcolonial subjects are represented within the Encyclopedia, and how this representation is driven (or exactly not driven) by the dearth of female contributors to the network. Asking students to write and rewrite Wikipedia encourages them to be engaged directly in public scholarship and knowledge construction. Even if their entries or revisions don’t *stick*, this kind of activity invites a critical discussion of agency that moves well beyond the choices we make inside the too often closed space of a physical classroom.

### "Twitter vs. Zombies"

* Source URL: http://twittervszombies.com/

* Creators: Pete Rorabaugh (Southern Polytechnic State University) and Jesse Stommel (University of Wisconsin-Madison)

“Twitter vs. Zombies” was a game originally designed by myself and Pete Rorabaugh in 2012. It was an experimental romp with emergent rules and the goals of building networked communities, introducing new users to Twitter, and helping them develop new media literacies. The three initial rules were incredibly simple, a catalyst for play and improvisation. The game has been hacked in at least 5 subsequent versions. In February 2013, for example, students in Pete Rorabaugh’s Georgia State University class and Janine DeBaise’s SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry class ran the second iteration of the game. Since then, students as far as Cairo, Egypt have reimagined the game. I share this resource as an example of an assignment or activity designed in such a way that it can build a self-governing community and enable that community to take full ownership of future iterations. In the best hybrid classes, the teacher is part and parcel. She might structure the learning in critical ways, but it is set loose and often iterates in new contexts and containers .

REBECCA: Please limit your annotations to 150 words. What do you mean by "the teacher is part and parcel." Part and parcel of what?

### "Occupy Class"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://occupyclass.org/
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Pete Rorabaugh (Southern Polytechnic State University)

“Occupy Class” is a site designed by the students in Pete Rorabaugh’s Spring 2012 course in Electronic Writing and Publishing at Georgia State University. According to Rorabaugh’s [description of the class](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/imr/2013/03/07/building-context-occupy-class-and-media-res), the goal was “for students to design, compose, edit, and publish their own content to the web that documented the unfolding narrative of Occupy.” For me, pedagogy is never ideologically neutral, and a hybrid teaching strategy can’t be about merely moving students from a closed physical space (the classroom) to a closed digital one (the learning management system). The work illustrated through Occupy Class is deeply connected to Critical Pedagogy and aims itself at helping learners understand how they are situated -- actively, politically, and with agency -- inside their much larger local and global communities. This is about not only having students do work for an authentic audience, but also having teachers and learners alike show up as full (and ethical) participants in those communities.

### "Twitter Adoption Matrix"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/a-framework-for-teaching-with-twitter/26223
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Rick Reo (George Mason University) and Mark Sample (Davidson College)

I am not a fan of rubrics, because they reduce dynamic (and often delightfully chaotic) learning activities to a series of discrete (neat and tidy) outcomes. The “Twitter Adoption Matrix,” co-created by Rick Reo and Mark Sample, looks upon first glance a little too like a rubric. However, upon closer inspection, it proves an invaluable starting place for a consideration of the various ways we might use social media to extend the environment of the physical classroom. I also appreciate that the matrix has a clear perspective. Rather than just offering options, Reo and Sample make relatively clear which activities are most pedagogically valuable (the ones toward the upper right edges of the matrix). I have been increasingly disillusioned by discussion forums inside of closed learning management systems. I have turned to Twitter as my primary tool for online discussion and community building. What I like most about this tool is that it functions both synchronously and asynchronously, can enable discussion in and beyond a physical space, and it encourages interactions between and outside institutional settings. It's important, though, to never be wed to one tool or platform, but rather to constantly think about how the pedagogies one tool enables can be ported to other platforms.

REBECCA: Please limit your annotations to 150 words. Again you might cut some of the personal commentary.  You might also consider moving this matrix to the resource list and replacing it with a different pedagogical resource that isn't twitter-based.  I'm not committed to that change, but I will note that you run the risk of this seeming like a twitter-heavy list of resources.

### "Note Tweeting"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://www.sadiron.com/teaching/tweeting-class-discussion-and-notes/
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Chuck Rybak (University of Wisconsin-Green Bay)

Chuck Rybak offers here an excellent example of how he has students using Twitter to extend an otherwise face-to-face discussion beyond a physical room. In this and other assignments, Rybak uses social media in his courses to build a literal and figurative *open-door* classroom. In his “note tweeting” activity, he has students turning “oral discussions into usable texts,” a set of dialogic (as opposed to monologic) notes for a discussion, both for students to review and as a way of allowing others not in the class to eavesdrop. As a key component, Rybak has his students [Storify](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/how-to-storify-why-to-storify/) their tweets, which makes a more permanent collection of the tweets and asks that Students curate (and narrate) their experience of the discussion. The students, then, move through several recursive layers: ideas in their brains, discussion in a physical room, Tweets as a sort of Greek chorus narrating and focusing the discussion, a Storify that curates those thoughts even further, response and feedback to the Storify, which can then be used to prompt future face-to-face discussions.

### "A Public Literary Twitter Role-Play"

* Source URL: http://shelleysfrankenstein.wordpress.com/frankenstein-a-public-literary-twitter-role-play-on-twitter/
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Petra Dierkes-Thrun (Stanford University)

Petra Dierkes-Thrun has run several iterations of the Public Literary Twitter Role-play, having students re-enact and inhabit texts like *The Portrait of Dorian Gray*, *Lolita*, and *Frankenstein*. Each of these experiments has had a slightly different prompt used to engage students in her physical class and also virtual participants around the world. Her [larger goals](http://www.fhi.duke.edu/events/petra-dierkes-thrun-lecture) for students are focused on “close-reading, critical thinking, and critical writing.” Ultimately, these experiments in Twitter Role-play bring a playful spirit to the work of close-reading, allowing students to embody their readings, so they are not only commenting on the text but putting their readings to use. The work of the students also becomes a massive effort in public digital humanities, drawing non-scholars into animated language-play and literary discussion. Dierkes-Thrun offers an important point about her work in the video linked above -- that she does not “make” students participate openly online but “invites” them to. In doing this kind of work, it is important to give thought to student privacy, data, and FERPA, but ultimately what is most important is that students be given space to make informed choices about how they will occupy the Web.

### "Social Media Design and Build"
* Screenshot: forthcoming
* Source URL: http://kathiiberens.com/teaching/sample-syllabi/design-build/
* Copy of Artifact: forthcoming
* Creator: Kathi Inman Berens (USC Annenberg)

This syllabus, from Kathi Inman Berens for a Social Media course at USC Annenberg, is an excellent example of how to implement a fully hybrid course. She works with students face-to-face, but also uses various synchronous video platforms to engage with them. The course itself reflects in its content on how we engage one another via digital media, and the students work in teams with real-world clients for their projects. My favorite bit from the syllabus: “I expect you to be on your laptops and smartphones during class.” And, then, “Connectivity is essential to our work.” She also asks students to keep a “Distraction Log,” which helps students “make observations about their own media consumption habits.” The course is “hybrid” in that it spans across media, across geography, and in real-world environments. When devising a syllabus of this sort, I would recommend creating spaces in a class that are private, semi-public, and fully public. Helping students understand how to move within and between these spaces is a key literacy for working in digital space.

In winter 2013, I co-taught with Kathi Inman Berens a small seminar comprised of four students, all non-traditional undergraduate students. We were equal collaborators, not teachers but co-learners, structuring the environment at the outset but receding as quickly as possible from roles of authority. Together with the students, we used Tumblr to build SpinePoetry.com, a social media campaign promoting the first exhibit of electronic literature at the Library of Congress. We worked directly with the Library of Congress, but the interactive site was designed to hold together as a work of its own. We also coordinated a physical event at the Lake Oswego Library outside Portland, OR. The task was to bring the Library of Congress to Portland and the Web -- and to bring Portland and the Web to the Library of Congress. The students also created a short documentary that was screened at the Library of Congress for the opening of the exhibit, and visitors to the physical exhibit made spine poems that they shared through the site. In our [artist statement](http://spinepoetry.com/about), we write, “Spine poems bridge the physical world of books with stories that are born digitally.”

I’ve said elsewhere that [Ferpa is not an excuse for bad pedagogy](https://twitter.com/Jessifer/status/441755367924436992). In this resource, Kevin Smith, Duke University’s Director of Copyright and Scholarly Communication, offers information (not to be confused with a legal opinion, as noted on the site) on the ethics and legalities of having students doing public work. Specifically, he tackles various methods for addressing FERPA concerns when having students working on public blogs. In short, inform students of the requirement from the start, offer the option of anonymity, remind students not to post private information, and consider offering an alternative if a student has major concerns about doing public work even under an alias. FERPA is in place to protect students, not to put artificial limits on their learning. As with any pedagogical decision, I suggest that our first concern be on protecting student agency -- ultimately, learners not teachers should make the critical choices about what, when, how, and where they learn.
