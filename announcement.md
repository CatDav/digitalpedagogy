# Announcing DIGITAL PEDAGOGY IN THE HUMANITIES: CONCEPTS, MODELS, AND EXPERIMENTS
# 
In conjunction with the Modern Language Association, we are happy to announce *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*,
an open-access, curated collection of downloadable, reusable, and remixable pedagogical resources for humanities scholars interested in the
intersections of digital technologies with teaching and learning. Taken as a whole, this collection will document the richly-textured culture of
teaching and learning that responds to new digital learning environments, research tools, and socio-cultural contexts, ultimately defining the
heterogeneous nature of digital pedagogy.

*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* will consist of approximately 50 keywords that articulate humanities pedagogy with new media, computation,
networked environments, and digital culture. Each keyword will have a curator who will briefly introduce a particular term in the context of teaching
and learning and then provide ten pedagogical resources, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, and lesson plans drawn from actual courses, classrooms,
and projects across the humanities. These resources will be annotated, attributed with metadata, and accompanied by lists of related materials for
further reading and future reference. After going through an open peer review process, all keyword entries will be published under Creative Commons licenses to encourage circulation, editing, and repurposing by other practitioners.

In short, *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* will share the everyday stuff of humanities teaching and learning, curated by instructors who are
well-versed in the practice of digital pedagogy.

We will update this GitHub repository as we move forward with lists of keywords, keyword contributors, and mentions of forthcoming presentations about
this project at university and college campuses across North America.
