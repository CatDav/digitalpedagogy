## FAQ

Q: Should curators circulate a formal CFP?
A: Yes, but please wait until you hear from the general editors that the MLA contracts have been countersigned. Curators should not think of this as a formal CFP but rather more of a crowdsourced "send me your ideas and relevant links." In case the curator acquires more links that she/he is able to accommodate in the keyword entry, there is the potential that the full set of submitted links, if put into a spreadsheet, could even be one of the "additional references" that the entry points to. We are encouraging less of a formal submission/review/accept/reject model and more of an informal, “send some links” model. It is  the curator's job to select and curate 10 links and to explain things in the curator's statement. 

Q: What should my CFP or public request include? 
A: The curator should indicate that she/he will be able to include only 10 responses and that she/he is serving as curator of this particular keyword and not of the whole collection Please use our project hashtag (#curateteaching) when making a public call 

Q: Do curators have to create a public call? 
A: No. 

Q: Who's work should be included in a keyword?
A: The keyword should speak to a range of assignments/institutions, with a privileging of undergrads but some inclusion of graduate education. We would like the collection to go beyond the usual suspects/circles, to be inclusive, to speak to a range of levels of instruction, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, etc.

Q: What other keywords have been included in this project?
A: See the list of keywords (and curators?)

Q: What kind of content are you looking for?
A: The keywords should place an emphasis on pedagogy, not just a list of neat assignments.
